Why Collection API?
	
	Arrays are fixed in size.

Collection API provides us
	Containers
		They are dynamic
		Some of them are sorted
		Some of them allow only unique elements
		some of them are thread-safe
		some of them are not thread-safe , so they are efficient
		Some of them allow u to store key and value 
		all the containers implement Serializable so that they can be easily 		persisted inside file system.

	Iterator
		allows u to traverse through containers.
	Algorithms
		sort,count,max,min etc.



Entire support for Collection API has been given inside "java.util" package.
