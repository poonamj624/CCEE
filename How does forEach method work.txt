forEach(System.out::println);     we are invoking


forEach() method's argument is "Consumer" functional interface with
	
		void	accept(T t)   // abstract method
			Performs this operation on the given argument.


implementation of Consumer

class ConsumerImpl implements Consumer
{
	void accept(T t)
	{
	   System.out.println(t);
		this is because u have asked accept to print an element provided
			System.out::println
	}
}

how forEach() method must have been designed

forEach(Consumer ref)
{
	traverse through the stream
	pass each and every element to "accept()" method like this:
		
		ref.accept(element);
	
}
