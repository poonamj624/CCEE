mapToInt(i -> i)           we are invoking

since we are passing lambda expression, mapToInt() method must have functional interface as an argument.

it's "ToIntFunction" with 
	
	int	applyAsInt(T value)    abstract method


how mapToInt must be working?


class ToIntFunctionImp implements ToIntFunction
{
	int applyAsInt(Integer value)
	{
		converts value into "int" 
		and return
	}
}

code inside "mapToInt()" method

mapToInt(ToIntFunction ref)
{
	traverse the stream which has  got numbers 12 and 20

	invoke 
		ref.applyAsInt(12)
			12 will come back as "int"
			store it inside "IntStream"
		ref.applyAsInt(20)
			20 will come back as "int"
			store it inside "IntStream"

	finally return this "IntStream"
}
